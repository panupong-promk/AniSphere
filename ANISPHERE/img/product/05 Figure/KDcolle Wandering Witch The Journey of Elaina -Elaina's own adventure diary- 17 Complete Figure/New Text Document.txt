I will keep writing my- our story, Wandering Witch: The Journey of Elaina. Yes, me!

A new illustration of Elaina, the protagonist of the T.V. anime Wandering Witch: The Journey of Elaina, has been made into a figure! The design is inspired by Elaina's own adventure diary, which is the main focus of the story. It's crafted to give the impression that Elaina is magically popping out from the diary that chronicles her adventurous days.
Enjoy the adventure diary that Elaina writes herself in your own hands.
