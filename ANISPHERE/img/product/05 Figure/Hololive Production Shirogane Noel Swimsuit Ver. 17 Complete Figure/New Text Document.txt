Danchou's hololive Summer!
From the popular VTuber group "hololive production" comes a statue figure of hololive 3rd Generation VTuber Shirogane Noel! The figure is based on an illustration created to commemorate Shirogane Noel's first anniversary.

Her pectoral muscles nearly bursting from her swimsuit and sun-kissed glow have been faithfully captured in figure form with detailed modeling and paintwork. Since the water splash base is created with translucent parts, the back of the figure also provides an appealing view!

Be sure to add this figure of Danchou enjoying summertime in the sea to your collection!
