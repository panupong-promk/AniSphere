Yuu Kamiya's stunning full-body illustration brought to life!
From "No Game No Life" comes a 1/7th scale figure of Shiro, member of the brother-sister gaming duo Kuuhaku. Based on the cover illustration from the art book "No Game No Life: Yuu Kamiya Art Works", Shiro has been recreated in figure form with incredibly dynamic sculptwork and vivid coloring.

The colorful playing cards flowing from her fluttering skirt have been captured in figure form as well. Shiro's adorable looks and soft, gentle expression are sure to charm all viewers. Be sure to add her to your collection!
