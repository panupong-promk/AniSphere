"Also... will you take me on a date?"
From the anime series "Date A Live" comes a figma of one of the main heroines, Tohka Yatogami, also known as the Spirit "Princess"!

Using the smooth yet posable joints of figma, you can create a variety of poses from the series.
A flexible plastic is used for important areas, allowing proportions to be kept without compromising posability.
She comes with three face plates including a serious face, a shouting face and a blushing face.
Her great sword Sandalphon, an attacking effect part, an interchangeable arm part to display her holding her sword and a kinako bread are all included as optional parts.
A large articulated figma stand is included to display the figma in a variety of poses.
