"I'm going into overtime now."
From the anime series "Jujutsu Kaisen" comes a Nendoroid of Kento Nanami! He comes with three face plates including a standard face, a combat face and a smiling face. Optional parts include his knife, a 7:3 effect part, his smartphone and a casse-croute sandwich, Kento's favorite.

Additionally, highlight stickers are included to make his glasses look as though light is reflecting off of them. Interchangeable parts to display him loosening his tie are included as well. Be sure to add him to your collection and display him with other Nendoroids from "Jujutsu Kaisen"!
